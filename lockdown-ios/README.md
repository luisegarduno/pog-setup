# Lockdown-IOS

One of my favorite IOS apps is/was [Lockdown](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lockdown-privacy-adblock-vpn/id1469783711), which in summary trackers on my iPhone.
Another key point as to why I liked it so heavily is because it was open-source ([GitHub](https://github.com/confirmedcode/Lockdown-iOS)).

As of recently, the application has added **several** paid features, thus unfortunately causing the repository to no longer be updated. 

Previously, when the application was fully free, the application would consistantly update the list of trackers to block.
The user would have access to **ALL** of them. However, now you must now pay for them :(

Within this folder are the "Advanced curated lists" that you must now pay for.
